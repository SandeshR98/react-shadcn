## Folder: `themes`

### Purpose

The `themes` folder contains all the styles, colors, typography, and other visual-related configurations used throughout the project. It provides a centralized location to define and manage different themes for the application, which can be applied globally or dynamically.

By organizing themes in this folder, the project achieves the following benefits:

1. **Consistency**: Centralized theme definitions ensure a consistent look and feel across the application.
2. **Customization**: Themes can be easily modified or switched, enabling a highly customizable user interface.
3. **Reusability**: Reusable theme definitions ensure that visual changes are reflected across the entire project.
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to the theme are made in a single location, making it easy to maintain and update styles globally.
5. **Developer Experience**: A well-organized theme structure improves collaboration between design and development teams.

## Folder Structure

The `themes` folder is structured to hold various theme-related files that define the visual elements of the application. A typical structure might look like this:

### Note this structure is just an example !!!!!

### `darkTheme.ts` and `lightTheme.ts`

These files define different themes for the application, such as a "dark mode" and a "light mode" theme. Each theme file contains the colors, typography, and other visual settings specific to that theme.

### `themeManager.ts`

This file is responsible for managing the active theme, applying theme changes dynamically, and providing a utility to switch between themes (e.g., dark mode and light mode).

### `types.ts`

This file defines TypeScript types related to theme configurations, such as color schemes, font families, and other visual properties, to ensure strong typing and consistency across theme files.

## How to Use Themes

To apply or switch between themes, follow these steps:

### Importing a Theme

To use a specific theme, you need to import the theme file and apply it using your theme management system. For example, if you're using a `themeManager.ts` to handle theme switching:

```typescript
import { darkTheme } from '../themes/darkTheme';
import { lightTheme } from '../themes/lightTheme';

// Apply the selected theme
applyTheme(darkTheme); // or applyTheme(lightTheme);
```

## Conclusion

The themes folder helps in maintaining a consistent and customizable styling approach across the application. It allows easy switching between different visual styles (e.g., dark mode and light mode) and ensures that styling remains modular, reusable, and maintainable.
