## Folder: `types`

### Purpose

The `types` folder serves as a centralized location for all TypeScript type definitions used throughout the project. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the following benefits:

1. **Consistency**: Shared type definitions reduce redundancy and ensure uniformity across the project.
2. **Reusability**: Types can be reused across components, services, and utilities, promoting a modular design.
3. **Maintainability**: Any updates to types only need to be made in one place, reducing errors and improving the maintainability of the codebase.
4. **Developer Experience**: Strong typing improves code readability, autocompletion, and debugging, leading to a smoother development process.
5. **Error Reduction**: TypeScript’s type-checking helps identify issues during development, minimizing runtime errors.

## How to Import a Type

To use a type defined in the `types` folder, you need to import it into your file. Below are several scenarios for importing types:

### Importing a Single Type

If the type is exported as a named export, you can import it like this:

```typescript
import { User } from '../types/User';
```

### Importing a Default Type

If the type is exported as a default export, you can import it like this:

```typescript
import User from '../types/User';
```

## How to Export a Type

### Named Export

You can export types as named exports. This is the most common approach. Here’s how you define and export a type:

```typescript
// Exporting a type
export type User = {
	id: number;
	name: string;
	email: string;
};
```

### Default Export

Alternatively, you can export a type as a default export. This method is useful when there is a primary type in a file that you want to export.

```typescript
// Exporting a type as default
export default type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

```

## Conclusion

By centralizing the TypeScript type definitions in the `types` folder, the project becomes more maintainable, consistent, and easier to manage as it grows. Always remember to import types where necessary and follow best practices for exporting and organizing them.

Happy coding! ✨
